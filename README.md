Say goodbye to traditional attendance systems! Our app combines location-based technology with attendance tracking, ensuring accurate and secure attendance records.
The app I created called A2Z Assist. A2Z Assist is a geotag-based mobile application powered by Firebase's cloud storage. It serves as an attendant solution for employers who need to track the attendance of their employees at specific locations. I will provide a real-time demo of the app's features, including login authentication, two-factor authorization, dashboard options, and the ability to take and upload geotagged images. This app ensures efficiency and discipline in maintaining employee attendance.
